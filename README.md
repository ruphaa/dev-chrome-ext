## Chrome Extension to display a DEV article everyday

This extension was build to randomly pick a dev article and display it everytime we open a new tab in Chrome browser. This worls is moving so fast, and it's really to catch up with blog posts, newsletters, technologies, talks and whatnot.

To leverage this too much of learning for some extent, I've build a chrome extension which will show up a dev article in your new tab. So you need not have to feel guilty if you miss to check out DEV site for a day.

A start to stay ahead of the game!
