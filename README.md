## Chrome Extension to display a DEV article everyday

This extension was build to randomly pick a dev article and display it everytime we open a new tab in Chrome browser. This world is moving so fast, and it's really hard to catch up with the blog posts, newsletters, technologies, talks and whatnot.

To leverage this "too much of learning" for some extent, I've build a chrome extension which will show up a dev article everytime you open up a new tab. So you need not have to feel guilty if you miss to check out DEV site for a day.

A start to stay ahead of the game!
